# RobbinHood-Contract
Democratize crypto for all

Robbin’ Hood (ROBBIN) is the ultimate savior of the common long term HODLers against the big bad evil whales of Cryptoham. There are just too many scams in the DEFI world and most of them are perpetrated by whales. Robbin’ Hood is here to be be the anti-whale token every step of the way. Our Defi smart contract on the BSC both redistributes BUSD coins back to HODLers on each transaction and more importantly punishes (discourages) large whale sells through scaled taxations.

Whales know how to game the system, but this is the FIRST hyper-deflationary contract that knows how to game them back. Let Robbin’ Hood fight for you and with you.

# FEATURES:
1. ROBBIN token holders benefit through static rewards in BUSD and also through the Buy-Back Arrow on every buy and sell transaction.
2. Buy Fee 11% - 5% tax, 3% buy back, 3% marketing
3. Sell Fee - 5% tax, 9% buy back, 3% marketing

ROBBIN Anti-Whales BuyBack Sword: Max buy/sell/transfer per transaction is 0.3% of Total Supply. A auto-adjust fee on sells further punishes large transactions and reduce the likelihood of a whale dump: this fee can go up to as high as 24%. (See chart above for current ROBBIN Sell Fee level)
